This project was built as a follow along from the Rust Book Guessing game chanpter 2.3. It is a simple number guessing game that will prompt the user to guess a number between 1 and 100. The program will then tell the user if their guess is too high or too low. The program will also keep track of the number of guesses the user has made and will tell the user if they have won or lost the game.

## How to run
To run this program, you will need to have Rust installed on your machine. You can find instructions on how to install Rust [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Once Rust is installed, you can run the program by navigating to the directory where the program is located and running the following command in your terminal:

```bash 
cargo run
```
## Usage
Once the program is running, you will be prompted to enter a number between 1 and 100. If your guess is too high or too low, the program will tell you. If your guess is correct, the program will tell you that you have won and will tell you how many guesses it took you to win. If you have guessed incorrectly 5 times, the program will tell you that you have lost and will tell you what the correct number was.
